Registry
  Registry it's a database that contains a lot of configuration information for the Operative System and software installed, things like   
  whether the Task Manager shows up, when things start, what happens when the computer shuts down, whenever you install a new piece of   
  software it insert values into Registry.
  installation/uninstallation results in record keys pointing to non existing files on Registry
  So the computer needs to wait to confirm that file actually exist(Fail out period of time)
  - Temporary Files
  - BitTorrent
Startup Process
  Installation process normally will automatically add themselves to startup routine.
  So maybe you don't need it but they're running in background
  -> So you need to clean up all the startup process and maybe if the program is unistalled that trigger pointint to stratup process need 
     to be removed

   -> Service Pack 1|2|3 needed 512 megs of ram in order to run well
